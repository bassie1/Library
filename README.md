#** Library
I would like to create a database to enable a library to run smoothly

## Spec
The spec is included in the repo

## Deliverables
The following files are needed to implement the requirements for this repo:
1. table.sql (create database and tabled)
2. sampledata.sql
3. reports.sql

## SQL Requirements
- primary key
- properly named columns
- proper data types
- not null as appropriate
- constraints
- files should be able to run repeatedly so include drop and use statements
